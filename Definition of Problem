In order to make your way through a maze, every time you
come to a two-way intersection, you make a right turn. If
you reach a dead end or return to a previous location and
orientation, you backtrack to the last intersection and turn
left instead. In this algorithm, the recursive abstraction
allows you to solve the maze with an already exhausted
portion removed.
